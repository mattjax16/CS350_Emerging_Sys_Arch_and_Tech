# CS350_Emerging_Sys_Arch_and_Tech

## Project Summary

The project involved developing a cloud-connected thermostat using the Texas Instruments (TI) development board, primarily focusing on temperature regulation and data communication via UART. The system was designed to read temperature data, control heating based on set-points, and communicate this information to a server, solving the problem of manual temperature monitoring and adjustment in a domestic environment.

## Strengths of the Project

##### What did you do particularly well?
One of the key strengths in this project was the successful integration and configuration of the TI board with the TMP116 temperature sensor. I effectively utilized UART communication to ensure reliable data transmission. My approach to designing and implementing the state machine logic for temperature control and button press handling was thorough and robust, leading to a stable and responsive thermostat system.

## Areas for Improvement

##### Where could you improve?
While the project met its fundamental goals, improvements can be made in enhancing the user interface and expanding the connectivity options, such as incorporating Wi-Fi for broader remote access. Further refinement in code optimization for power efficiency and exploring advanced temperature control algorithms would also be beneficial.

## Tools and Resources for Future Projects

##### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
This project has introduced several valuable tools and resources into my repertoire, notably:

- The Texas Instruments development ecosystem, including their SDKs and debugging tools.
- UART communication protocols and their implementation in embedded systems.
- Online forums and technical documentation specific to TI boards and sensors, which will be invaluable in troubleshooting and expanding on future IoT projects.


## Transferable Skills

##### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills developed during this project, particularly in hardware-software integration, state machine design, and serial communication, are highly transferable. These skills are applicable in a wide range of IoT and embedded system projects, as well as in coursework that involves hardware interfacing, real-time system design, and data communication protocols.

## Project Maintenance and Adaptability

##### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To ensure maintainability, the code was thoroughly commented and structured in a modular fashion, allowing for easy identification and modification of specific functionalities. Consistent coding standards and meaningful variable naming enhanced readability. The systemâ€™s adaptability was ensured through a design that allows easy integration of additional sensors and communication protocols, paving the way for future enhancements and scalability.
